# MLSPstyletransfer
The style transfer algorithm for the twitter bot @mlstylephoto
This code runs along my MLSPtweetstream code on an AWS EC2 t2.micro instance.  Due to the compute limitations on this instance, the height and width of the image has to be severly reduced.  Running this code on a modern, well equipped computer would allow it to produce higher quality images.
